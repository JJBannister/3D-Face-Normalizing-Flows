# 3D-Face-Normalizing-Flows

This repository contains the code associated with two papers that apply normalizing flow models to 3D facial data:

[A Deep Invertible 3-D Facial Shape Model for Interpretable Genetic Syndrome Diagnosis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9749923)

[Detecting 3D Syndromic Faces as Outliers using Unsupervised Normalizing Flow Models]()
